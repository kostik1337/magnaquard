OpenJam entry - fight aliens with a huge human-like robot.

## building

You'll need [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) engine binaries and CMake to build this. In CMake, set URHO3D_HOME to where the engine is.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make ..

to run

    ./bin/openjam-entry
    
## playing

  Although it's not really obvious, your robot runs along the Moebius strip-shaped space station. Leave marks and read them later by running into them to get a power up. To win (or better to say, to not to loose), shoot aliens and not get shot by aliens too much. At the top of the screen there's damage bar on the left and energy bar on the right. When the energy bar is full, press space and LEAVE A MARK.

## controls

  - space to (re)start
  - WASD keys to move
  - mouse to aim and shoot
  - space to leave a mark
